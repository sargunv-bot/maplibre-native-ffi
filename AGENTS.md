# AGENTS.md

This project is a C API for MapLibre Native, built for low-level language
bindings and host integrations that need a C boundary instead of direct C++
interop or the popular MapLibre Android/iOS SDKs.

## Project map

- `include/` — Public C API headers (the stable ABI surface).
- `src/` — C++ implementation behind the C headers, plus render backend adapters
  (Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL) and the Zig test support shim.
- `bindings/` — Language bindings (Kotlin, Rust, Swift, Zig, .NET) that wrap the
  C API in idiomatic target-language interfaces.
- `examples/` — Small demo apps per language/backend (`zig-map`, `rust-map`,
  `zig-readback`, `lwjgl-map`, `swift-map`).
- `third_party/` — Vendored dependencies, primarily the MapLibre Native git
  submodule.
- `docs/` — Astro/Starlight documentation site and generated API reference.

## Workflow

```bash
# Install/refresh all tools, submodules, and dependencies
mise install

# List available tasks across the workspace
mise tasks --all

# Build the native library (also runs configure)
mise run build

# Build and run C API tests (also runs build)
mise run test

# Build and run Rust binding tests (also runs build)
mise run //bindings/rust:test

# Headless smoke test — no display needed
mise run //examples/zig-readback:run

# GUI map app — use a brief timeout or run in background
mise run //examples/zig-map:run:owned-texture

# Build and test for a different variant (override auto-detected env)
mise -E linux-x64-egl run test

# Run formatters and linters on _all_ files (will stage affected files)
mise run fix

# Run formatters and linters on targeted files (will stage affected files)
hk fix [FILES...]
```

Available mise envs: `linux-x64-vulkan`, `linux-x64-egl`, `linux-arm64-vulkan`,
`linux-arm64-egl`, `macos-arm64-metal`, `macos-arm64-vulkan`, `macos-arm64-egl`,
`windows-x64-vulkan`, `windows-x64-wgl`. The host-matching variant is selected
automatically via `.miserc.toml`.

Formatters and linters run automatically on pre-commit; you usually don't need
to run them manually.

The environment is managed by mise. If you need to run a command that's not
already a mise task, use `mise exec -- ...` so repository tools and dependency
paths are available.

## Pull requests

When you open a pull request, follow the repository PR template and write
**Summary** and **Test plan** in at most one sentence each. The user will expand
the PR description if more detail is needed. More context:
[AI_POLICY.md](./AI_POLICY.md).

## Project Invariants

### General

- Campsite rules apply: leave anything you touch tidier than when you found it.
- The environment is defined by `mise`; pixi is the current desktop native
  library provider behind mise-managed paths.
- The bindings are meant to be low level and broadly analogous to each other and
  to the C API, exposing MapLibre concepts directly, while following language
  conventions for memory and thread safety. Prioritize safety, similarity, and
  idioms, in that order.
- Bindings expose MapLibre Native concepts directly. Add redundant APIs or
  convenience helpers only when they are strongly justified by target-language
  safety or ergonomics.
- Bindings do not reimplement native validation; they validate binding-owned API
  shape, state, lifetimes, and memory safety.
- We're currently in a prerelease state, so breaking API changes are allowed and
  encouraged over leaving backwards compatibility shims.

### Prose

Use positive wording for guidance. Use negative wording for real prohibitions,
safety rules, and hard boundaries.

- Prefer: "Examples stay small and focused."
- Avoid: "Examples should not grow into full applications."
- Prefer: "Higher-level adapters may add execution models above this layer."
- Avoid: "This layer should not try to manage execution models for every
  possible host."

### Specifications

For specification writing:

- Standalone and testable: each requirement should be checkable on its own,
  without pointing at an example or the current tree.
- Add, don’t restate or hedge: link to other docs instead of copying them; avoid
  “or equivalent”, unnamed MAYs, and vague outcomes.
- Scope by constraint: family-wide sections state behavior; platform- or
  API-specific rules belong in clearly labeled subsections.

### Testing

- The bindings tests include broad integration coverage for the C/C++ layer on
  targets where they run.
- For tests that _must_ reach below the bindings, there are dedicated Zig tests
  in src/c_api/tests.
- Each binding's test suite should stand on its own for the C API domains and
  targets it supports, using public binding APIs to validate both native
  workflows and binding-owned safety behavior.
- Avoid trivial tests, tests that verify constants, tests that assert a negative
  (unless valuable), tests that simply test third party code; we want to keep
  our test suite robust and high-value.
- Example apps don't need tests.
- Every test skip should be strictly justified. We do not skip rendering tests
  because the CI environment doesn't support them; we fix the environment.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

The cloud VM is bootstrapped before each session: system packages and the `mise`
binary are baked into the snapshot, and the startup update script runs
`mise install` (the same chain as the devcontainer `postCreateCommand`). `mise`
is on the default `PATH` via `/usr/local/bin/mise`. Use the standard tasks in
the Workflow section above; the notes below cover only non-obvious caveats.

- The host variant auto-selects to `linux-x64-vulkan`. Rendering runs on
  software Vulkan (lavapipe, from the `mesa-vulkan-drivers` apt package), so
  `mise run //examples/zig-readback:run` works headlessly without a display.
- The default system compiler is set to gcc/g++ (`update-alternatives` for `cc`
  and `c++`), matching CI and the devcontainer. Keep it that way: when `c++`
  points at clang, the build auto-enables `clang-tidy`, and the bundled conda
  `clang-tools` package ships no builtin headers, so the C API target fails with
  `'stddef.h' file not found`. If a build hits missing
  `stddef.h`/`cstdio`/`algorithm` headers, confirm `cc`/`c++` resolve to
  gcc/g++.
- Headless rendering on the Vulkan variant needs no extra env. The EGL/OpenGL
  variant (`mise -E linux-x64-egl run ...`) needs `EGL_PLATFORM=surfaceless` and
  `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true`, as set in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
- GUI examples (`zig-map`, `rust-map`, `lwjgl-map`, `dotnet-map`) need a display
  and are build-only in CI; `zig-readback` is the headless render smoke test.
- Swift bindings/examples and Android/iOS targets require Apple or Android hosts
  and do not run on this Linux VM.
- `mise install` rewrites `mise.lock` on different machines; this drift is
  expected (CI excludes `mise.lock` from its clean-tree check) and should not be
  committed.
